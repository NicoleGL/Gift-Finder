# Gift-Finder

This was my first project. It is a Gift Finder prototipe implemented with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

It has a few screens where the user can select their budget, the categories of the gift and the personality of the gift recipient. Given this data, the web will search for gifts that match this description and show them with a link to the selling page.

I later migrated it to React and organized it. That code is in the Gift-Finder-React repository.
